## Install dependencies

Run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md en (Deprecated) As of spaCy v3.0, symlinks like "en" are not supported anymore.
python -m spacy link en_core_web_md en (Deprecated) As of spaCy v3.0, symlinks like "en" are not supported anymore.
```

> With pre-commit installed, the `black` and `doctoc` hooks will run on every `git commit`.
> If any changes are made by the hooks, you will need to re-add changed files and re-commit your changes.

## Run the bot

Use `rasa train` to train a model.

Then, to run, first set up your action server in one terminal window, listening on port 5056:
```bash
rasa run actions --port 5056
```

Note that port 5056 is used for the action server, to avoid a conflict when you also run the helpdesk bot as described below in the `handoff` section.

In another window, run the duckling server (for entity extraction):

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 rasa/duckling
```

Then to talk to the bot, run:
```
rasa shell --debug
```

Note that `--debug` mode will produce a lot of output meant to help you understand how the bot is working
under the hood. To simply talk to the bot, you can remove this flag.


You can also try out your bot locally using Rasa X by running
```
rasa x
```

Refer to our guided workflow in the [Wiki page](https://github.com/RasaHQ/financial-demo/wiki/Using-Rasa-X-with-the-Financial-Demo) for how to get started with Rasa X in local mode.


## Overview of the files

`data/nlu/nlu.yml` - contains NLU training data

`data/nlu/rules.yml` - contains rules training data

`data/stories/stories*.yml` - contains stories training data

`actions.py` - contains custom action/api code

`domain.yml` - the domain file, including bot response templates

`config.yml` - training configurations for the NLU pipeline and policy ensemble

`tests/` - end-to-end tests


## Things you can ask the bot

The bot currently has five skills. You can ask it to:
1. Transfer money to another person
2. Check your earning or spending history (with a specific vendor or overall)
3. Answer a question about transfer charges
4. Pay a credit card bill
5. Tell you your account balance

It also has a limited ability to switch skills mid-transaction and then return to the transaction at hand.

For the purposes of illustration, the bot recognises the following fictional credit card accounts:

- `emblem`
- `justice bank`
- `credit all`
- `iron bank`

It recognises the following payment amounts (besides actual currency amounts):

- `minimum balance`
- `current balance`

It recognises the following vendors (for spending history):

- `Starbucks`
- `Amazon`
- `Target`

You can change any of these by modifying `actions.py` and the corresponding NLU data.

If configured, the bot can also hand off to another bot in response to the user asking for handoff. More [details on handoff](#handoff) below.

## Handoff

This bot includes a simple skill for handing off the conversation to another bot or a human.
This demo relies on [this fork of chatroom](https://github.com/RasaHQ/chatroom) to work, however you
could implement similar behaviour in another channel and then use that instead. See the chatroom README for
more details on channel-side configuration.


Using the default set up, the handoff skill enables this kind of conversation with two bots:

<img src="./handoff.gif" width="200">


### Try it out

The simplest way to use the handoff feature is to do the following:

1. Clone [chatroom](https://github.com/RasaHQ/chatroom) and [Helpdesk-Assistant](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helpdesk-assistant) alongside this repo
2. In the chatroom repo, install the dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```
3. In the chatroom repo, build and serve chatroom:
```bash
yarn build
yarn serve
```
4. In the Helpdesk-Assistant repo, install the dependencies and train a model (see the Helpdesk-Assistant README)
5. In the Helpdesk-Assistant repo, run the rasa server and action server at the default ports (shown here for clarity)
   In one terminal window:
    ```bash
    rasa run --enable-api --cors "*" --port 5005 --debug
    ```
    In another terminal window:
    ```bash
    rasa run actions --port 5055 --debug
    ```
6. In the Financial-Demo repo (i.e. this repo), run the rasa server and action server at **the non-default ports shown below**
   In one terminal window:
    ```bash
    rasa run --enable-api --cors "*" --port 5006 --debug
    ```
    In another terminal window:
    ```bash
    rasa run actions --port 5056 --debug
    ```
7. Open `chatroom_handoff.html` in a browser to see handoff in action


### How it works

Using chatroom, the general approach is as follows:

1. User asks original bot for a handoff.
2. The original bot handles the request and eventually
   sends a message with the following custom json payload:
    ```
        {
            "handoff_host": "<url of handoff host endpoint>",
            "title": "<title for bot/channel handed off to>"
            }
    ```
    This message is not displayed in the Chatroom window.
3. Chatroom switches the host to the specified `handoff_host`
4. The original bot no longer receives any messages.
5. The handoff host receives the message `/handoff{"from_host":"<original bot url">}`
6. The handoff host should be configured to respond to this message with something like,
   "Hi, I'm <so and so>, how can I help you??"
7. The handoff host can send a message in the same format as specified above to hand back to the original bot.
   In this case the same pattern repeats, but with
   the roles reversed. It could also hand off to yet another bot/human.

### Bot-side configuration

The "try it out" section doesn't require any further configuration; this section is for those
who want to change or further understand the set up.

For this demo, the user can ask for a human, but they'll be offered a bot (or bots) instead,
so that the conversation looks like this:


For handoff to work, you need at least one "handoff_host". You can specify any number of handoff hosts in the file `actions/handoff_config.yml`.
```
handoff_hosts:
    helpdesk_assistant:
      title: "Helpdesk Assistant"
      url: "http://localhost:5005"
    ## you can add more handoff hosts to this list e.g.
    # moodbot:
    #   title: "MoodBot"
    #   url: "http://localhost:5007"
```

Handoff hosts can be other locally running rasa bots, or anything that serves responses in the format that chatroom
accepts. If a handoff host is not a rasa bot, you will of course want to update the response text to tell the user
who/what they are being handed off to.

The [Helpdesk-Assistant](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helpdesk-assistant) bot has been set up to handle handoff in exactly the same way as Helpdesk-Assistant,
so the simplest way to see handoff in action is to clone Financial-Demo alongside this repo.

If you list other locally running bots as handoff hosts, make sure the ports on which the various rasa servers & action servers are running do not conflict with each other.


## Testing the bot

You can test the bot on the test conversations by:

- start duckling
- running  `rasa test`.

This will run [end-to-end testing](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/testing-your-assistant/#end-to-end-testing) on the conversations in `tests/test_stories.yml`.

All tests must pass.



## Rasa X Deployment

To [deploy financial-demo](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/how-to-deploy/), it is highly recommended to make use of the [one line deploy script](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/one-line-deploy-script/) for Rasa X. 

As part of the deployment, you'll need to set up [git integration](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/integrated-version-control/#connect-your-rasa-x-server-to-a-git-repository) to pull in your data and configurations, and build or pull an action server image.


## Action Server Image

You will need to have docker installed in order to build the action server image. If you haven't made any changes to the action code, you can also use the [public image on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rasa/financial-demo) instead of building it yourself.

To build & tag the image, run:

```bash
export ACTION_SERVER_DOCKERPATH=<dockerID>/<name-of-image>:<tag-of-image>
make docker-build
```

Run the action server container:

```bash
make docker-run
```

Perform a smoke test on the health endpoint:

```bash
make docker-test
```

Once you have confirmed that the container is working, push the container image to a registry:

```bash
# login to a container registry with your credentials
docker login  

# check the registry logged into
docker system info | grep Registry

# push the action server image
make docker-push
```

# CI/CD

## Summary

As explained in the [Setting up CI/CD](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/setting-up-ci-cd) section of the Rasa documentation, Continous Integration (**CI**) is the practice of merging in code changes frequently and automatically testing changes as they are committed. Continuous Deployment (**CD**) means automatically deploying integrated changes to a staging or production environment. Together, they allow you to make more frequent improvements to your assistant and efficiently test and deploy those changes.

A CI/CD pipeline is used to test, build and deploy the financial-demo bot to AWS EKS.

The pipeline uses GitHub Actions, defined in  `.github/workflows/cicd.yml`. It includes these jobs:

![](images/cicd.png)

**[params](https://github.com/RasaHQ/financial-demo/blob/d40467b4fb2a7d4fb072b86a2828a8cec662eb63/.github/workflows/cicd.yml#L26)**

- Performs smoke tests to ensure basic operations are all OK.



## GitHub Secrets

Secrets can be added to your GitHub repository by going to `Settings > Secrets` and selecting `New repository secret`. 

When entering values, be sure to omit quotes.

#### AWS IAM User API Keys:

To configure the aws cli in Github Actions, create IAM User API Keys as described below, and add them as GitHub secrets to the repository:

- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = `Access key ID`
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = `Secret access key` 

#### Rasa Enterprise License:

To define a pull secret in Github Actions for the private GCR repo, you'll need to retrieve the private values from your Rasa Enterprise license file ([docs](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/install/helm-chart#5-configure-rasa-x-image)) and add them as GitHub secrets to the repository:

- GCR_AUTH_JSON_PRIVATE_KEY_ID = `private_key_id`
- GCR_AUTH_JSON_PRIVATE_KEY = `private_key`
- GCR_AUTH_JSON_CLIENT_EMAIL = `client_email`
- GCR_AUTH_JSON_CLIENT_ID = `client_id`

An alternative approach to GCR repo authentication would be with the [gcloud credential helper](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#gcloud-helper).

#### Helm chart Credentials

To use safe_credentials in Github Actions through `values.yml` ([docs](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/install/helm-chart#3-configure-credentials)), add following GitHub Secrets to the repo, replacing each `<safe credential>` with a different alphanumeric string and choosing a `<username>` for the initial user. 

*(Please use **safe credentials** to avoid data breaches)*

- GLOBAL_POSTGRESQL_POSTGRESQLPASSWORD = `<safe credential>`
- GLOBAL_REDIS_PASSWORD = `<safe credential>`
- RABBITMQ_RABBITMQ_PASSWORD = `<safe credential>`
- RASAX_INITIALUSER_USERNAME = `<username>`
- RASAX_INITIALUSER_PASSWORD = `<safe credential>`
- RASAX_JWTSECRET = `<safe credential>`
- RASAX_PASSWORDSALT = `<safe credential>`
- GLOBAL_POSTGRESQL_POSTGRESQLPASSWORD = `<safe credential>`
- GLOBAL_POSTGRESQL_POSTGRESQLPASSWORD = `<safe credential>`



## AWS Preparation

The CI/CD pipeline of financial-demo uses AWS for all the storage & compute resources.

After cloning or forking the financial-demo GitHub repository you must set up the following items before the pipeline can run.

### IAM User API Keys

The CI/CD pipeline uses the [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html#cliv2-linux-install).

The [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html#cliv2-linux-install) needs a set of IAM User API keys for authentication & authorization:

In your AWS Console, go to the IAM dashboard to create a new set of API keys:

  - Click on Users

  - Click on Add user

    - User name = findemo  *(The actual name is not important, we will never use this name directly)*

      Choose "**programmatic access**." This allows you to use the aws cli to interact with AWS.

    - Click on Next: Permissions

      - Click on *Attach existing policies directly*

        For IAM access, you can choose “**AdministratorAccess**”, or limit access to only what is needed by the CD pipeline.

    - Click on Next: Tags

    - Click on Next: Review

    - Click on Create user

    - Store in a safe location: `Access key ID` & `Secret access key`


### SSH Key Pair

To SSH into the EC2 worker nodes of the EKS cluster, you'll need an SSH Key Pair

- In your AWS Console, go to **EC2 > Key Pairs**, and create a Key Pair with the name `findemo`, and download the file `findemo.pem` which contains the private SSH key. 
  **Note that the name `findemo` is important, since it is used by the CI/CD pipeline when the cluster is created.**

### Local AWS CLI

Before the CI/CD pipeline can run, you will use the AWS CLI locally to create some resources and need to install & configure the CLI locally.

#### Install AWS CLI v2

See the [installation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

#### Configure your AWS CLI

```bash
# AWS CLI version 2.1.26 or later
aws --version

# Configure AWS CLI
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: -----          # See above: IAM User API Keys
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: -------    # See above: IAM User API Keys
Default region name [None]: us-west-2    # The CI/CD pipeline uses us-west-2 
Default output format [None]: 

# Check your configuration
aws configure list [--profile profile-name]

# verify it works
aws s3 ls
```

### ECR repository & S3 bucket

The CI pipeline creates two artifacts:

- An action server docker **image**, which is pushed to an **AWS ECR** repository.
- A trained rasa **model**, which is copied to an **AWS S3** bucket

Run these commands to create the storage for these artifacts. These commands run the AWS CLI and create an ECR repository and an S3 bucket:

```bash
# create ECR repository with name `financial-demo`
make aws-ecr-create-repository

# create S3 bucket with name `rasa-financial-demo`
make aws-s3-create-bucket
```



## EKS production cluster

If the production cluster is already set up, you can skip this section.

This section describes the initial deployment of the financial-demo bot on an EKS production cluster. 

This initial deployment is done manually. After that, the deployment is maintained & upgraded automatically by the CI/CD pipeline.

### Preparation

Before you can create or interact with an EKS cluster, you must install  `eksctl`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `jp`, and define some environment variables.

#### Install eksctl

See the [installation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html)

If you use Ubuntu, you can issue the command:

```bash
make install-eksctl
```

#### Install kubectl

See the [installation instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)

If you use Ubuntu, you can issue the command:

```bash
make install-kubectl
```

#### Install helm

See the [installation instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

If you use Ubuntu, you can issue the command:

```bash
make install-helm
```

#### Install jp

See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/jmespath/jp#installing)

If you use Ubuntu, you can issue the command:

```bash
make install-jp
```

#### Set environment variables

There are many ways to set the required environment variables in your local environment. 

One way is to create a file  `./secret/envs_export`, with this content:

```bash
# source this file to set the environment variables the same as the GitHub secrets.
export GCR_AUTH_JSON_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=...
export GCR_AUTH_JSON_PRIVATE_KEY='-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-...-END PRIVATE KEY-----\n'
export GCR_AUTH_JSON_CLIENT_EMAIL='...'
export GCR_AUTH_JSON_CLIENT_ID=...
export GLOBAL_POSTGRESQL_POSTGRESQLPASSWORD=...
export GLOBAL_REDIS_PASSWORD=...
export RABBITMQ_RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=...
export RASAX_DEBUG_MODE=false
export RASAX_INITIALUSER_USERNAME=admin
export RASAX_INITIALUSER_PASSWORD=...
export RASAX_JWTSECRET=...
export RASAX_PASSWORDSALT=...
export RASAX_TOKEN=...
export RASA_TOKEN=...
```

Then, create the environment variables with the command:

```bash
source ./secret/envs_export
```

### Create the EKS cluster

Create the EKS production cluster, with name `financial-demo-production`:

```bash
make aws-eks-cluster-create AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=financial-demo-production
```

Some other useful 'Makefile functions' to interact with an EKS cluster:

```bash
make aws-eks-cluster-list-all

# in commands below, default name of cluster = financial-demo-<current branch name>
#
make aws-eks-cluster-describe AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=<name of cluster>
make aws-eks-cluster-describe-stacks AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=<name of cluster>
make aws-eks-cluster-delete AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=<name of cluster>
```

### Configure `kubeconfig`

Add the EKS  cluster information to `~/.kube/config`, and set the `current-context` to that cluster:

```bash
make aws-eks-cluster-update-kubeconfig AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=financial-demo-production

# make sure kubectl is now looking at the correct EKS cluster
make kubectl-config-current-context
```

### Install/Upgrade Rasa Enterprise

### Versions 

#### Select compatible versions

Get compatible versions for rasa-x, rasa and rasa-sdk from [compatibility matrix](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/changelog/compatibility-matrix/)

For the rasa-x-helm chart, the latest version should work. When installing a very old version, you might need to use an older  helm chart version, selected with:

```bash
#.............NAME   URL
helm repo add rasa-x https://rasahq.github.io/rasa-x-helm
helm repo update

# .................NAME  /CHARTNAME
$ helm search repo rasa-x/rasa-x --versions
NAME         	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION                                 
rasa-x/rasa-x	2.0.0        	0.41.1     	Rasa X Helm chart for Kubernetes / Openshift
rasa-x/rasa-x	1.16.0       	0.40.1     	Rasa X Helm chart for Kubernetes / Openshift
..
rasa-x/rasa-x	1.7.0        	0.33.0     	Rasa X Helm chart for Kubernetes / Openshift
rasa-x/rasa-x	1.6.13       	0.30.1     	Rasa X Helm chart for Kubernetes / Openshift
# NOTE: APP VERSION = Rasa X version
```



#### rasa & rasa-sdk

```bash
# file: requirements.txt
rasa[spacy]==2.5.2
rasa-sdk==2.5.0

# file: Dockerfile
FROM rasa/rasa-sdk:2.5.0
```



#### rasa-x & rasa-x-helm

```yaml
# file: Makefile

RASAX_TAG := 0.39.3
RASAX_HELM_CHART_VERSION := 2.0.0
```



#### Build & push action server docker image

Build, run, test & push the action docker server image, with name:

- `<ECR URI>/financial-demo:<current branch name>`

```bash
# check out the `main` branch.
# -> the branch name is used as the image tag
git checkout main

# build the image
make docker-build

# test it
make docker-run
make docker-test
make docker-stop

# Login & push the docker image to the AWS ECR repository
make aws-ecr-docker-login
make docker-push
```

#### Install/Upgrade Rasa Enterprise

Install/Upgrade Rasa Enterprise, using the action server docker image that was uploaded to the ECR repository:

```bash
# make sure kubectl is looking at the correct EKS cluster
make aws-eks-cluster-update-kubeconfig AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=financial-demo-production
# check it
make kubectl-config-current-context  AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=financial-demo-production

# check out the `main` branch.
# -> The action server docker image with tag = current branch name will be installed
git checkout main

# if you want to re-install rasa enterprise completely from scratch:
make rasa-enterprise-uninstall
make rasa-enterprise-delete-pvc-all
make aws-eks-namespace-delete

# create namespace `my-namespace`
make aws-eks-namespace-create

# create/refresh gcr-pull-secret, for Rasa Enterprise image
make pull-secret-gcr-create

# create/refresh ecr-pull-secret, for action server image
make pull-secret-ecr-create

# Install/Upgrade Rasa Enterprise with the action server
make rasa-enterprise-install

# Check Rasa Enterprise Health
make rasa-enterprise-check-health

# To troubleshoot, highly recommended to use OCTANT, see Appendix C
```

### Train, test & upload model to S3

```bash
# check out the `main` branch.
git checkout main

# Train the model: `models/<current branch>.tar.gz`
make rasa-train

# In another window, start duckling server
docker run -p 8000:8000 rasa/duckling

# Run the end-to-end tests
make rasa-test

# Upload `models/<current branch>.tar.gz` to S3
# Note: This does not mean the model is deployed to Rasa Enterprise,
#       which is done in the next step.
make aws-s3-upload-rasa-model
```

### Deploy, Tag & Smoketest the trained model

```bash
# Configure ~/.kube/config and set current_context
make aws-eks-cluster-update-kubeconfig  AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=financial-demo-production

# Deploy rasa model
make aws-s3-download-rasa-model
make rasa-enterprise-model-delete
make rasa-enterprise-model-upload
make rasa-enterprise-model-tag

# Wait about 1 minute, so rasa-production can download, upack & load the model

# Smoketest
make rasa-enterprise-smoketest
```

### DNS

Optionally, if you want to access Rasa Enterprise at your own (sub)-domain name, define a DNS record of type CNAME with your domain service provider:

- **name of sub-domain**:  `aws-financial-demo`  

  *==> This example name will resolve to `aws-financial-demo.my-domain.com`*

- **Type**: `CNAME`

- **Content**: `--------.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com` 

  *==> This is the hostname of the External Application Load Balancer that AWS EKS created during the deployment. You can get this hostname with the command:*

  ```bash
  make rasa-enterprise-get-loadbalancer-hostname
  ```

- **TTL (Time to Live)**: 1 Hour

- **Priority**: 

It might take some time for things to propagate, but you can verify it with commands like nslookup & dig:

```bash
########################################################################
# use `nslookup -type`
nslookup -type=CNAME aws-financial-demo.my-domain.com
aws-financial-demo.my-domain.com canonical name = ---.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com.

########################################################################
# use `dig`
dig CNAME aws-financial-demo.my-domain.com
...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
aws-financial-demo.my-domain.com. ---- IN CNAME ---.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com.

```

Once propagated, you can access Rasa Enterprise at **http://aws-financial-demo.my-domain.com**

## Trouble Shooting

If something goes wrong with the CI/CD pipeline, you should:

- Browse the [workflow logs](https://github.com/RasaHQ/financial-demo/actions)
- Peek in [.github/workflows/cicd.yml](https://github.com/RasaHQ/financial-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/cicd.yml) to see what the pipeline is doing at the moment of trouble
- Trouble shoot it from your local computer

The following steps will most likely reveal what is going wrong: 

- Before you can use the Makefile commands locally, follow the [Preparation](#preparation) steps:

  - Install eksctl, kubectl, helm, jp
  - Set the environment variables

- Then, configure kubectl, so you are looking at the correct EKS cluster.

  - To troubleshoot the EKS test cluster for your current branch

    ```bash
    make aws-eks-cluster-update-kubeconfig
    ```

  - To Troubleshoot the EKS production cluster

    ```bash
    make aws-eks-cluster-update-kubeconfig AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=financial-demo-production
    ```

- Make sure you are now looking at the correct cluster by checking the current context:

  ```bash
  make kubectl-config-current-context
  ```

- Then, issue these commands to check things out.

  - Trouble shoot the EKS cluster

    ```bash
    # Check the available commands for the `aws-eks` cluster:
    $ make aws-eks # Do NOT press `Enter`, but press the `Tab` key twice
    aws-eks-cluster-create                    aws-eks-cluster-info
    aws-eks-cluster-delete                    aws-eks-cluster-list-all
    aws-eks-cluster-describe                  aws-eks-cluster-status
    aws-eks-cluster-describe-stacks           aws-eks-cluster-update-kubeconfig
    aws-eks-cluster-exists                    aws-eks-namespace-create
    aws-eks-cluster-get-certificateAuthority  aws-eks-namespace-delete
    aws-eks-cluster-get-endpoint
    
    # Trouble shoot the cluster
    make aws-eks-cluster-exists
    make aws-eks-cluster-status
    make aws-eks-cluster-info
    ```

  - Trouble shoot the S3 storage of the trained model

    ```bash
    # Check the available commands for the `aws-s3` bucket:
    make aws-s3 # Do NOT press `Enter`, but press the `Tab` key twice
    aws-s3-create-bucket        aws-s3-list-rasa-models
    aws-s3-delete-bucket        aws-s3-rasa-model-exists
    aws-s3-download-rasa-model  aws-s3-upload-rasa-model
    
    # Trouble shoot the S3 storage of the trained model
    make aws-s3-list-rasa-models
    make aws-s3-rasa-model-exists
    ```

  - Trouble shoot the ECR storage of the action server image

    ```bash
    # Check the available commands for the `aws-ecr` repository:
    make aws-ecr # Do NOT press `Enter`, but press the `Tab` key twice
    aws-ecr-create-repository        aws-ecr-get-repositoryUri
    aws-ecr-docker-login             aws-ecr-image-exists
    aws-ecr-get-authorization-token  aws-ecr-list-images
    
    # First, login to the ECR (This expires after a while, so redo it)
    make aws-ecr-docker-login
    
    # Then, Troubleshoot the ECR storage of the action server image
    make aws-ecr-list-images
    make aws-ecr-image-exists
    ```

    

  - Trouble shoot the Rasa Enterprise deployment

    ```bash
    # Check the available commands for the `rasa-enterprise` deployment:
    $ make rasa-e # Do NOT press `Enter`, but press the `Tab` key twice
    rasa-enterprise-check-health               rasa-enterprise-get-secrets-rabbit
    rasa-enterprise-get-access-token           rasa-enterprise-get-secrets-redis
    rasa-enterprise-get-base-url               rasa-enterprise-install
    rasa-enterprise-get-chat-token             rasa-enterprise-model-delete
    rasa-enterprise-get-loadbalancer-hostname  rasa-enterprise-model-tag
    rasa-enterprise-get-login                  rasa-enterprise-model-upload
    rasa-enterprise-get-pods                   rasa-enterprise-smoketest
    rasa-enterprise-get-secrets-postgresql     rasa-enterprise-uninstall
    
    # Trouble shoot the rasa enterprise deployment
    make rasa-enterprise-get-pods
    make rasa-enterprise-check-health
    make rasa-enterprise-smoketest
    ```

## Cleanup of AWS resources

The CI/CD pipeline creates unique artifacts and infrastructure for each branch. This is all cleaned up once a branch is deleted, by a special workflow `.github/workflows/cleanup.yml`.

You can also do a manual cleanup, either from the AWS CLI, or from the AWS Console.

### From the command line:

- AWS ECR:

  ```bash
  # list the action server images in the ECR
  make aws-ecr-list-images
  
  # delete the action server image of current branch
  make aws-ecr-delete-image
  
  # delete an action server image created by another branch
  make aws-ecr-delete-image GIT_BRANCH_NAME=my_other_branch
  ```

- AWS S3:

  ```bash
  # list the rasa models in the S3 bucket
  make aws-s3-list-rasa-models
  
  # delete the rasa model of current branch
  make aws-s3-delete-rasa-model
  
  # delete a rasa model created by another branch
  make aws-s3-delete-rasa-model GIT_BRANCH_NAME=my_other_branch
  ```

- AWS EKS:

  ```bash
  # list the EKS clusters
  make aws-eks-cluster-list-all
  
  # to delete ALL the test clusters
  make aws-eks-cluster-delete-all-test-clusters
  
  # delete the test cluster of the current branch
  make aws-eks-cluster-delete
  
  # delete a test cluster created by another branch
  make aws-eks-cluster-delete GIT_BRANCH_NAME=my_other_branch
  ```
  
  

### From the **AWS console**:

- AWS ECR:

  In the AWS Console, go to the ECR repository `financial-demo`, and delete the action server images.

- AWS S3:

  In the AWS Console, go to the S3 bucket `rasa-financial-demo` , and delete the rasa models.

- AWS EKS:

  In the AWS Console, go to CloudFormation, and delete all the stacks in reverse order as created by the `eksctl` command.

  When a stack fails to delete due to dependencies, you have two options:

    - Option 1: Manually delete the resources that the stack is not able to delete. (**RECOMMENDED**)

      You can do this by drilling down into the **CloudFormation stack delete events** messages and deleting items bottom-up the dependency tree.

      One example of a bottom-up delete sequence is when deletion of the VPC fails:

      - **EC2 > Load Balancers**: first, delete the ELB load balancer of the cluster. Look at the Tags to see what cluster a loadbalancer belongs to.
      - **VPC > Virtual Private Cloud: Subnets**: then, delete the two subnets of the cluster.  Look at the Name to see what cluster a subnet belongs to.
        - This will also delete the EC2 > Network interfaces, named `eni-xxxx`
        - You cannot delete Subnets until the ELB load balancers are deleted
      - **VPC > Virtual Private Cloud: Your VPCs**: finally, delete the VPC of the cluster. Look at the Name to see what cluster a VPC belongs to.
        - This will also delete all associated:
          - security groups (`sg-xxx`)
          - internet gateways (`igw-xxx`)
          - subnets (`subnet-xxx`)

      After cleaning up, try again to delete the **AWS CloudFormation** stack.

      If it still does not delete, iterate the manual cleanups until it does.

      Again, this can be a painful process, but once the CloudFormation stacks delete properly, you are guaranteed that you have cleaned up all the EKS related resources created by the CI/CD pipeline.

  - Option 2: Select to retain the resources that have dependency errors. (**NOT RECOMMENDED**)

    The stack delete operation will simply skip deleting them. This is NOT recommended, because you will clutter up your AWS account with many unused resources.

## Appendix A: The AWS EKS cluster

We use *eksctl* to create the clusters. It creates many AWS resources with CloudFormation templates. 

Some of these AWS resources are:

- A VPC with
  - Public & private subnets
  - Internet & NAT Gateways
  - Route Tables
- An IAM EKS service role
- An EKS Cluster Control Plane
- An EKS Managed nodegroup of EC2 instances

The cluster context is also added to the `~/.kube/config` file.

The VPC created looks something like this:

![](images/financial-demo-eks-test-vpc.png)

The EKS Control Plane interacts with the the EKS Data Plane (the nodes), like this:

```

## Appendix D: AWS EKS references

There are two commands to create AWS EKS clusters;  `eksctl` & `aws eks`.  

- The `eksctl` cli is the most complete, and it is what we ended up using.

- The `aws eks` cli does not support to launch worker nodes to the cluster control plane. This has to be done manually from the AWS Console, which makes it unsuited for a CI/CD pipeline where everything needs to be done via scripting (=> infrastructure as code).

The following references are useful for learning about AWS EKS, and it is highly recommended to manually build test-clusters with both the `eksctl` & `aws eks` commands to help demystify the AWS resources that are being generated:
